# Wafer-Fault-Detection-ML-Project_With_CI_CD_Pipeline
 In electronics, a wafer (also called a slice or substrate) is a thin slice of semiconductor used for the fabrication of integrated circuits. The goal is to build a machine learning model which predicts whether a wafer needs to be replaced or not
